The editor gives you full control over the logic you can add. For example, it's fairly common to want to add markdown-like shortcuts to editors. So that, when you start a line with "> " you get a blockquote that looks like this:

> A wise quote.

Order when you start a line with "## " you get a level-two heading, like this:

## Try it out!

Try <span>mark</span> it out for yourself! Try starting a new line with ">", "-", or "#"s.

<div>Block</div>
