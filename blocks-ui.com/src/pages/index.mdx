# Blocks

A JSX-based page builder for creating beautiful websites without writing
code. Blocks comes with hundreds of components carefully designed and implemented
with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com).

The editor exports production-ready React code, and then reads it back in,
making it one of the first of its kind.

_Blocks is currently in early alpha and only supports a constrained
subset of JSX source code._
