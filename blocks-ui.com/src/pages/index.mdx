# Blocks

**Blocks is currently under development**

A JSX-based page builder for creating beautiful websites without writing
code. Blocks comes with hundreds of components carefully designed and implemented
with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com).

The editor reads and writes production-ready React code, making it an
innovative tool for teams.
