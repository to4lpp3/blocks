# üìö Blocks

> Empowering authors to write dynamic, engaging, and immersive content without leaving
their editor

Blocks is a rich text editor with all the capabilities of components thanks to [MDX][mdx].
It's a powerful WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) built for the content web. You can
choose a block from an ever-expanding library or even install your own from [npm][].

## What is a block?

A block refers to a piece of content or a component. It's a section of your content.
A document is a collection of blocks.

Blocks can be simple like a paragraph of text or a box with a tomato background color.
Blocks can be complex like an embedded spreadsheet or a chart that fetches live data.

## How does it work?

Technically speaking, it is a block-based editor backed by [MDX][mdx] and the
[React][react] ecosystem. The editor is embedded into a GitHub compatible CMS
powered by [Netlify Identity][netlify-identity] and [Gatsby][gatsby]. When you
edit a document it's automatically synced to GitHub as a commit giving you a
full history of all edits.

Blocks maintains no server side element and never sees your data. You own your content.
