# 📚Blocks

Blocks empowers authors to write dynamic, engaging, and immersive content without leaving
the editor.

## Features

- 📸**Customizable**: Render your own components in the editor
- 📨**Open and authorable**: Underneath it's nothing but [MDX][mdx] not a JSON schema or HTML
- 🔐**Zero lock in**: You own your content, Blocks just makes it nicer to edit
- 🖼**WYSIWYG**: See what will be published in real time

## How does it work?

Technically speaking, it is a block-based editor backed by [MDX][mdx] and the
[React][react] ecosystem. The editor is embedded into a GitHub compatible CMS
powered by [Netlify Identity][netlify-identity] and [Gatsby][gatsby].
